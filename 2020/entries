I joined my org's DEI committee in 2020, after my then manager had mentioned it in a team meeting. I told my manager I was interested in joining and I soon got an invite from {{PGM Googler}}. She was a co-lead for the committee and explained the 3 subcommittees to me. I said that I was most interested in Advocacy, since they did a biannual survey and I had previously taken a marketing research class and it seemed similar. She added me to committee mailing list, which gave me access to all of the subcommittee meetings and the chats, effectively on boarding me.
